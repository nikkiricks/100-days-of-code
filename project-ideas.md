# Project Ideas

In an effort to not just do learning and tutorials I will outline here what I will do to do that:

### Challenge Sites

- Exercism challenges in Ruby, possibly in JavaScript too

### Learning

- Working through Codecademy's courses (finishing the 2nd React one I'm currently on)

### Tutorials

- Finishing the Gatsby tutorial I'm currently going through

### Projects

- Possibly start another Arduino project
- Look into building an app that fakes a bad connection to get off of video calls
- I've seen people making backgrounds for zoom calls - that looks like fun
- I really like the chain method and have considered building an app (if there's not currently a great one)

- My podcast club has been wanting a site - and they're not into trello

### Github Clean Up

- Edit my current NodeBots repo and take out the "Now" clock project to have it's separate repo
